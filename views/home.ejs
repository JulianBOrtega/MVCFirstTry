    <h3 class="mvc-center">They targeted gamers.</h3>
    <p class="mvc-center"><em>Gamers</em></p>
    <p>
      We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most
      mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

      We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

      We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a
      single extra point of damage per second.

      Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests
      over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such
      gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

      Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts
      destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

      These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one
      without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the
      games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been
      called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group
      that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've
      threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving
      we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and
      friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed
      reflex.

      Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to
      challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.
